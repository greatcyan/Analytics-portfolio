## About Me
Hi. I'm Cyrus Baruc. It was June 2012, two months after graduating from college where I began my career in the tech industry as a Board Repair Specialist at Teradyne Philippines, where I honed my skills for three years before transitioning to Linksphere Technologies, continuing in the same capacity. Throughout these two tenures, I refined my abilities in troubleshooting, problem-solving, and data analysis. My exposure to diagnosing boards using automated test equipment, coupled with analyzing test logs to identify failures, sparked my interest in Data Analytics.

Motivated by this newfound passion, I embarked on a journey of self-education in Excel, spearheading process improvement initiatives and crafting dashboards enriched with macros, advanced Excel formulas, and data visualization techniques. Concurrently, I pursued online courses in Python and Data Analytics, while also undertaking freelance projects as a Python developer.

Embracing this pivot towards the data realm, I became a Finance Business Analyst at Lexmark Research and Development Corporation and am now fully immersed in the field of Data Analytics, equipped with a robust skill set and an unwavering commitment to continuous learning and development. Here I stand today, ready to contribute and grow in this dynamic and ever-evolving industry.

## Portfolio
### Cebu Province - Provincial Dashboard
The Excel dashboard was developed and designed as part of my Data Associate Training requirements. It highlights the interplay among unique tourist attractions, population size, infrastructure, talent output, and the business climate. Primarily, it serves to aid the Local Government Units of Cebu Province in comparing data across cities and municipalities for planning and development. Additionally, the dashboard can also serve as a high-level guide for tourists and businessmen looking to invest in Cebu.

### Marketing Dashboard
The marketing dashboard is a powerful analytical tool designed to provide a comprehensive view of the organization's marketing performance. It centralizes key performance indicators (KPIs) and revenue trends, offering dynamic commentaries and actionable insights. 

#### Purpose

The primary purpose of this dashboard is to:
- **Track and Visualize KPIs**: Monitor crucial metrics such as customer acquisition cost, conversion rates, and return on investment (ROI) in real-time.
- **Analyze Revenue Trends**: Understand how different revenue streams are performing over time and identify patterns that can inform future strategies.
- **Correlate Marketing Efforts with Financial Outcomes**: Examine the direct impact of promotional activities on net revenue, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize marketing spend.
- **Inform Strategic Decisions**: Utilize the insights gained from the dashboard to make informed decisions about where to allocate resources for maximum impact.

By highlighting the interdependencies between marketing expenditures and revenue generation, the dashboard underscores the necessity of strategic investment in marketing to drive growth. It serves as a decision-making compass, guiding marketers and executives towards more profitable and efficient marketing strategies.
