# About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Cyrus Baruc. Data analysis has been the cornerstone of my career. In June 2012, two months after graduating from college, I began my career in the tech industry as a Board Repair Specialist at Teradyne Philippines. There, I honed my skills for three years before transitioning to Linksphere Technologies, continuing in the same capacity. Throughout these two positions, I refined my abilities in troubleshooting, problem-solving, and data analysis. My exposure to diagnosing boards using automated test equipment, along with analyzing test logs to identify failures, sparked my interest in Data Analytics. 

In 2017, driven by a blend of curiosity and a zeal for acquiring new skills, I ventured into trading local stocks on the Philippine Stock Exchange. It was during this time that I discovered AmiBroker (https://www.amibroker.com), a technical analysis tool that refined my stock selection process, and subsequently, I delved into the world of coding.

Motivated by this newfound passion, I embarked on a journey of self-education in Excel, spearheading process improvement initiatives and crafting dashboards enriched with macros, advanced Excel formulas, and data visualization techniques. Concurrently, I pursued online courses in Python and Data Analytics, and soon after completing these courses, I landed a freelance opportunity as a Python developer.

Embracing this pivot towards the data realm, I became a Finance Business Analyst at Lexmark Research and Development Corporation and am now fully immersed in the field of Data Analytics, equipped with a robust skill set and an unwavering commitment to continuous learning and development. Here I stand today, ready to contribute and grow in this dynamic and ever-evolving industry.

## Cebu Province - Provincial Dashboard
The Excel dashboard was developed and designed as part of my Data Associate Training requirements. It highlights the interplay among unique tourist attractions, population size, infrastructure, talent output, and the business climate. Primarily, it serves to aid the Local Government Units of Cebu Province in comparing data across cities and municipalities for planning and development. Additionally, the dashboard can also serve as a high-level guide for tourists and businessmen looking to invest in Cebu.
