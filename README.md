# About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Cyrus Baruc. Data analysis has been the cornerstone of my career. In June 2012, two months after graduating from college, I began my career in the tech industry as a board repair specialist at Teradyne Philippines. There, I honed my skills for three years before transitioning to Linksphere Technologies, continuing in the same capacity. Throughout these two positions, I refined my analytical skills and abilities in troubleshooting, problem-solving, and data analysis. My exposure to diagnosing boards using automated test equipment, along with analyzing test logs to identify failures, sparked my interest in Data Analytics. 

In 2017, driven by a blend of curiosity and a zeal for acquiring new skills, I ventured into trading local stocks on the Philippine Stock Exchange. It was during this time that I discovered ***AmiBroker*** (https://www.amibroker.com), a technical analysis tool that refined my stock selection process, and subsequently, I delved into the world of coding.

Motivated by this newfound passion, I embarked on a journey of self-education in ***Excel***, spearheading process improvement initiatives and crafting dashboards enriched with macros, advanced Excel formulas, and data visualization techniques. Concurrently, I pursued online courses in ***Python and Data Analytics***, and soon after completing these courses, I landed a freelance opportunity as a Python developer.

Embracing this pivot towards the data realm, I became a Finance Business Analyst at Lexmark Research and Development Corporation supporting FP&A and R. My key responsibilities include understanding business requirements and translating them into the BI context, as well as developing automated dashboards using ***Power BI*** in a visually appealing format. This not only automates the reporting process, but also allows stakeholders to understand their data at a quick glance. Additionally, data refresh and commenting capabilities are automated using automation tools including ***Power Query Dataflows***, ***Power Apps***, and ***Power Automate***.

I am now fully immersed in the field of Data Analytics, equipped with a robust skill set and an unwavering commitment to continuous learning and development. Here I stand today, ready to contribute and grow in this dynamic and ever-evolving industry.
