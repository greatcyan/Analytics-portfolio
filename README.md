# About Me
Hi, my name is Cyrus Baruc, and I am an electronics technologist, a stock trader, and a business intelligence professional.

I began my career in the tech industry as a specialist in diagnosing test equipment used by semiconductor manufacturers. With extensive experience in electronics and automation, I provided high-quality circuit board repair and test development services to our customers. After a decade in this role, during which I felt I had fully perfected my troubleshooting skills, I decided to advance my skills in data analysis to further enrich my professional portfolio.

Data analysis was already an integral part of my job, helping me identify test system issues and failures. We extracted test logs generated by the equipment and analyzed the measurements using a statistical tool called process capability (CPk). I was fascinated by how data insights helped me pinpoint which circuitry on the board to troubleshoot and quickly identify faulty components.

Motivated by this newfound passion, I began creating reports and dashboards through self-learning and eventually enrolled in online courses to familiarize myself with data analysis tools beyond Excel. I became proficient in tools like Python, Tableau, and SQL, gaining experience in app and dashboard development using them.

In 2023, I transitioned my career from being an Electronics Technologist to a Business Analyst. I enjoy navigating the vast landscape of data while making an impact on my stakeholders. This transition allowed me to learn new systems and tools like Power BI and SAP, as well as new skillsets, particularly in communication, project management, and finance business acumen.

Now, I am excited to showcase some of the projects I have developed during my data journey.
