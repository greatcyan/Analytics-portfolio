# About Me
Hi, my name is Cyrus Baruc and I am an organized business intelligence analyst specializing in project planning, data preparation, and dashboard design. I transform raw data into actionable insights to drive business strategies.

I have been in the tech industry for 12 years. I spent almost 11 years in semiconductor test engineering and 1 year in data and business analysis. My extensive experience with my former role equipped me with analytical and problem-solving skills. Also during that time, I gradually developed my data analysis and coding skills. I believe this experience has helped me during my career transition from the electronics field to data and business analytics. 

In my current role, I have been part of a Digital Transformation (DX) team, where I supported finance and accounting business functions on a global scale. My collaboration with these functions involved understanding their requirements, translating them into the Business Intelligence (BI) context, and providing solutions to achieve business goals. This process encompassed requirements gathering, project planning, collaboration with the IT team (when necessary), dashboard development, user training, User Acceptance Testing (UAT), deployment, and maintenance.

I am now fully immersed in the field of data and business analytics, equipped with a robust skill set and an unwavering commitment to continuous learning and development. Here I stand today, ready to contribute and grow in this dynamic and ever-evolving industry.
